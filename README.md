## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshokThangavel/iristest-html.git
cd iristest-html
````

### Running the Application with Docker

Build and start the app using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
### Usage

Run the code below to set the report path:
```objectscript
do ##class(IrisTest.HTML.Report).SetUTReportHtmlPath(pPath)
```
Run the code below to get the previously defined path:
```objectscript
do ##class(IrisTest.HTML.Report).GetUTReportHtmlPath()
```

If you define the path through `SetUTReportHtmlPath()`, you do **not** need to pass the file path when generating the report.
If you *do* pass a file path, that path will be used.
Otherwise, the default location within the `manager directory` will be selected.

- **pUnitTestId** — Integer
- **pFilePath** — Directory path (file name not required)

```objectscript
set st = ##class(IrisTest.HTML.Report).GenerateReport(pUnitTestId, pFilePath)
```
On success, the generated file name is printed
